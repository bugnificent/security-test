# Wireshark TLS Handshake Data - `yusufasik.com`

This repository contains a JSON file generated from Wireshark capturing TLS handshake data for HTTP/HTTPS requests where the `Server Name Indication (SNI)` matches `"yusufasik.com"`. Additionally, this repository includes automated security scan reports generated by **ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)** and **Checkmarx** to ensure the security and integrity of the domain's communication.

---

## Overview

The captured data includes detailed information about the SSL/TLS handshake process for requests that reference the domain `yusufasik.com`. This JSON file contains all relevant information regarding the server's public key, cipher suites, and other key aspects of the SSL/TLS connection setup. The repository also includes automated security scan reports to analyze potential vulnerabilities and ensure secure communication.

---

## File Structure

### JSON File (Wireshark Data)
The JSON file consists of the following data:

- **Source and Destination IP**: The IP addresses involved in the connection.
- **TLS Handshake Information**: Details about the TLS handshake, including protocol versions, cipher suites, and extensions.
- **Server Name Indication (SNI)**: The domain name (`yusufasik.com`) used during the handshake.
- **Session Keys**: Information related to the session setup (if decrypted or relevant).

### Automated Security Scan Reports
- **ZAP Report**: An `.html` file containing the results of an automated security scan performed by OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy).
- **Checkmarx Report**: A report generated by Checkmarx Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool, analyzing the source code for security vulnerabilities.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a comprehensive record of TLS handshakes for the domain `yusufasik.com`, along with automated security scan reports. This data can be used for:

- **Security analysis**: Inspecting how the TLS handshake is conducted for this domain and identifying potential vulnerabilities.
- **Network troubleshooting**: Understanding the communication process and identifying potential issues with HTTPS connections.
- **Compliance and auditing**: Ensuring the domain is using secure protocols and certificates for encrypted communication.
- **Vulnerability assessment**: Using ZAP and Checkmarx reports to identify and remediate security risks in the application and network communication.

## How to Use

### Viewing the Wireshark JSON Data
1. Open the JSON file in any JSON viewer or text editor.
2. Examine the details of the TLS handshake, focusing on the fields related to the `SNI` and cipher suites.
3. Use the file for further analysis of SSL/TLS handshake security or to investigate specific network requests involving the domain `yusufasik.com`.

### Example of a Typical Entry

```json
{
  "frame_number": 1,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-30T12:34:56.789",
  "source_ip": "192.168.1.10",
  "destination_ip": "93.184.216.34",
  "tls_handshake": {
    "protocol_version": "TLS 1.2",
    "cipher_suite": "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256",
    "extensions": {
      "server_name": "yusufasik.com"
    }
  }
}
```

### Interpreting the ZAP Report
The ZAP report is an `.html` file that provides detailed insights into potential security issues, such as:
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- **SQL Injection**
- **Insecure HTTP Headers**
- **Broken Authentication**
- **Security Misconfigurations**

#### Steps to Use:
1. Open the `.html` file in your browser.
2. Review the **Alerts** section, categorized by severity (High, Medium, Low, Informational).
3. Follow the **Recommendations** provided to address identified vulnerabilities.
4. Mark any **False Positives** as resolved if they are not applicable.

### Interpreting the Checkmarx Report
The Checkmarx report analyzes the source code for security vulnerabilities, including:
- **Code Injection**
- **Hardcoded Secrets**
- **Insecure Dependencies**
- **Authentication Bypass**
- **Data Exposure**

#### Steps to Use:
1. Open the Checkmarx report file.
2. Review the **Vulnerability Types** and their severity levels.
3. Examine the **Code Snippets** to locate the source of the issue.
4. Follow the **Remediation Guidance** to fix the vulnerabilities.

## How to Generate the Files

### Wireshark JSON File
The JSON file was generated using Wireshark with the following filter applied:

```sql
tls.handshake.extensions_server_name contains "yusufasik.com"
```

### Steps for Generating the File:
1. **Capture Traffic**: Use Wireshark to capture network traffic on the desired network interface.
2. **Apply the Filter**: Apply the filter `tls.handshake.extensions_server_name contains "yusufasik.com"` to capture only traffic related to the `yusufasik.com` domain.
3. **Export to JSON**: Export the filtered packet capture to a JSON file format.
4. **Save the File**: Store the file for later analysis or reporting.

### ZAP and Checkmarx Reports
1. **Run ZAP Scan**:
   - Use OWASP ZAP to perform an automated security scan on the domain or application.
   - Export the results as an `.html` file.
2. **Run Checkmarx Scan**:
   - Use the Checkmarx SAST tool to analyze the source code for vulnerabilities.
   - Export the results in the desired format.

---

## Tools Used
- **Wireshark**: Network protocol analyzer for capturing the TLS handshake and generating the JSON file.
- **OWASP ZAP**: Open-source tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications.
- **Checkmarx**: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool for analyzing source code for security vulnerabilities.
- **JSON**: Standard data format used for storing and exchanging structured information.

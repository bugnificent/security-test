# Wireshark TLS Handshake/ZAP Scan Data - `yusufasik.com`

This repository contains a JSON file generated from Wireshark capturing TLS handshake data for HTTP/HTTPS requests where the `Server Name Indication (SNI)` matches `"yusufasik.com"`.
Additionally, this repository includes automated security scan reports generated by ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) and Checkmarx to ensure the security and integrity of the domain's communication.

## Overview

The captured data includes detailed information about the SSL/TLS handshake process for requests that reference the domain `yusufasik.com`. This JSON file contains all relevant information regarding the server's public key, cipher suites, and other key aspects of the SSL/TLS connection setup. The repository also includes automated security scan reports to analyze potential vulnerabilities and ensure secure communication.

## File Structure

### JSON File Data

The JSON file consists of the following data:

- **Source and Destination IP**: The IP addresses involved in the connection.
- **TLS Handshake Information**: Details about the TLS handshake, including protocol versions, cipher suites, and extensions.
- **Server Name Indication (SNI)**: The domain name (`yusufasik.com`) used during the handshake.
- **Session Keys**: Information related to the session setup (if decrypted or relevant).

### Automated Security Scan Reports

The HTML file consists of the following data:

- **ZAP Report**: An .html file containing the results of an automated security scan performed by OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy).

- **Checkmarx Report**: A report generated by Checkmarx Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool, analyzing the source code for security vulnerabilities.
  
## Purpose

The purpose of this file is to provide a record of TLS handshakes for the domain `yusufasik.com`, along with automated security scan reports. which can be useful for:

- **Security analysis**: Inspecting how the TLS handshake is conducted for this domain and whether there are any security concerns.
- **Network troubleshooting**: Understanding the communication process and identifying potential issues with HTTPS connections.
- **Compliance and auditing**: Ensuring the domain is using secure protocols and certificates for encrypted communication.
- **Vulnerability assessment**: Using ZAP and Checkmarx reports to identify and remediate security risks in the application and network communication.

## How to Use

### Viewing the Wireshark JSON Data:

1. Open the JSON file in any JSON viewer or text editor.
2. Examine the details of the TLS handshake, focusing on the fields related to the `SNI` and cipher suites.
3. Use the file for further analysis of SSL/TLS handshake security or to investigate specific network requests involving the domain `yusufasik.com`.

### Interpreting the ZAP Report

The ZAP report is an .html file that provides detailed insights into potential security issues, such as:

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- SQL Injection
- Insecure HTTP Headers
- Broken Authentication
- Security Misconfigurations

### Example of a Typical JSON Entry

```json
{
  "frame_number": 1,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-30T12:34:56.789",
  "source_ip": "192.168.1.10",
  "destination_ip": "93.184.216.34",
  "tls_handshake": {
    "protocol_version": "TLS 1.2",
    "cipher_suite": "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256",
    "extensions": {
      "server_name": "yusufasik.com"
    }
  }
}
```

## How to Generate the File
The JSON file was generated using Wireshark with the following filter applied:

```sql
tls.handshake.extensions_server_name contains "yusufasik.com"
```

## Steps for generating the file:

- **Capture Traffic**: Use Wireshark to capture network traffic on the desired network interface.
- **Apply the Filter**: Apply the filter tls.handshake.extensions_server_name contains "yusufasik.com" to capture only traffic related to the yusufasik.com domain.
- **Export to JSON**: Export the filtered packet capture to a JSON file format.
- **Save the File**: Store the file for later analysis or reporting.

## Tools Used
- **Wireshark**: Network protocol analyzer for capturing the TLS handshake and generating the JSON file.
- **JSON**: Standard data format used for storing and exchanging structured information.
